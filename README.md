## Overview

This project is a Real-Time Chat Application built using React. It allows users to send and receive messages in real-time. The app utilizes WebSockets or a similar real-time communication library to ensure that messages are exchanged instantly between connected users.

## Features

Real-Time Messaging: Send and receive messages instantly between multiple users.

Join Chat Room: Users can join specific chat rooms to communicate with others.

User Authentication: (Optional) Allow users to sign in with a username or through third-party authentication (e.g., Google or Facebook).

Online Status: See which users are online in the chat room.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-app.git
cd chat-app
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Setup the WebSocket server:

If you are using a custom WebSocket or Node.js server, make sure the server is running and accessible.
Alternatively, you can use services like Firebase for real-time messaging.

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

Join a Chat Room: Users can enter their name and join a chat room.

Once in the room, they can type and send messages, which will be visible to all users in the room.

Messages appear in a chat window, and the app updates in real-time without refreshing the page.
